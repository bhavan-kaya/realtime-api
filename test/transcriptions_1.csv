Recording (7).m4a,"Absolutely. Diving into the electric vehicle world is exciting. That's one of the few common struggles. People don't support self-charging. Race anxiety and gut-wrack loss are one thing. It's like this. If you buy a slower running car and that isn't so friendly to buy, they're usually awful. Is anything on your mind about electric vehicles?"

Recording (7).m4a,"Well, how soon can you get me one?"
Recording (7).m4a,"I'm looking to check with our network to confirm the exact timeline.

Okay, I have another one last question for today. Am I talking to a real person?"
