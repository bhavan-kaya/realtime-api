Recording (10).m4a,Do you have any x-files available to test drive right now?
Recording (10).m4a,"Absolutely. It looks like we don't have the S860i x-drive breadcrumb in our current lineup of test drive vehicles. But hey, I'm all about options. We can take a look at some other stellar BMWs we have in stock for a spin. How does that sound?"
Recording (11).m4a,Do you have any X-Fives available to test drive right now?
Recording (11).m4a,Absolutely! We've got the new 2025 BMW X-Five PHE X-Drive 50 ready to roll. This plug-in hybrid SUV in Bitonic Blue Metallic with a Canberra Beige interior is both stylish and efficient. When would you like to come in?
Recording (11).m4a,"Thank you for calling. For quality of service, please call...?"
Recording (2).m4a,Do they still make the X5 in a 3rd row?
Recording (3).m4a,"Can you tell me the difference between M60, X5, and an X-Dry40i?"
Recording (3).m4a,"Oh, this one's easy. The 2025 X5 and 60i, that's the beast. V8 engine, pure power, a real engine. The X-Dry40i is soft, refined, and still packs a pungent impact. So you aiming for that raw, unbeatable performance, sweet.?"
Recording (4).m4a,"Can you give me your best price on M60 that you mentioned the one with Oh, you got it. The M850i X-Drive Grand Coupe is a real showstopper. Let me work some magic and find the best price for you. What's the budget range you're playing with?"
Recording (4).m4a,"If there's a deal to be had, I'll make sure you get it.?"
Recording (5).m4a,Can you tell me the difference between the M package and the actual M car itself?
Recording (5).m4a,"Ah, looking for the real deal, I see. So the M package on a BMW is all about that scorny flair. Aggressive looks, sharper lines, racier feel. But under the hood, it's pretty much the same engine as the standard version. Now the M850i, that's a whole different beast. Full M performance, fire-breathing power, and ready to dominate the road. So, want to look that, or be that?"
Recording (6).m4a,I'm interested in the X3 and I was trying to see what kind of special programs you have on the X3 new one. Let's dive into those details. I'm sure we can tailor something just for you. Ready to talk numbers?
Recording (7).m4a,What's the X3 National Lease Payment?
Recording (7).m4a,"The X3 National Lease Payment is a news-based, free-to-air, and free-to-air, independent, free-to-air, free-to-air, free-to-air, free-to-air, free-to-air, free-to-air, free-to-air, free-to-air.?"
Recording (8).m4a,Do you have any X3's in stock available to drive?
Recording (9).m4a,Do you have any x3s to test drive at the moment?
Recording.m4a,"I was wanting to see the difference between the 2025 X5 and the 2024, what were the difference between these two models?"
